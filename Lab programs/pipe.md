# Pipes in Operating Systems

## Introduction

A **pipe** in an operating system is a method that allows two programs or commands to exchange data during execution. It acts as a temporary connection between processes, facilitating the flow of information from one to the other. This is an efficient way to communicate without using temporary files or more complex data-sharing methods.

In this `README.md`, we'll explain pipes in simple terms and provide an example of how pipes are used in programs to allow communication between a **parent** and **child process**.

## How Does a Pipe Work?

- A **pipe** allows data to flow in one direction, typically from one program’s **output** (stdout) to another program’s **input** (stdin).
- It works on a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** basis, meaning the first data written into the pipe will be the first data read out.
- Pipes are often used to connect two or more commands in shell scripting and can also be used in programming to connect **parent** and **child processes**.

### Command-Line Pipe Example

In the command line, pipes can be used as follows:

```bash
ls | grep .txt
```

- The `ls` command lists the files in the directory.
- The pipe (`|`) passes the output of `ls` to `grep`, which filters the list to only show `.txt` files.

### Programmatic Use of Pipes

In programming, pipes are used between parent and child processes. The parent can send data to the child, and vice versa, using the pipe. Pipes use **file descriptors** internally, where one end of the pipe is used for **writing** and the other for **reading**.

## Code Example: Pipe Between Parent and Child Process

Below is a simple C program that demonstrates the use of a pipe to allow communication between a parent and a child process.

### Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int pipefds[2];  // Array to hold two file descriptors: pipefds[0] for reading, pipefds[1] for writing
    char write_msg[] = "Hello from parent!";
    char read_msg[50];

    // Create the pipe
    if (pipe(pipefds) == -1) {
        perror("Pipe failed");
        return 1;
    }

    pid_t pid = fork();  // Fork the process to create a child

    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        return 1;
    }

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        close(pipefds[1]);  // Close the write end of the pipe, child will only read
        read(pipefds[0], read_msg, sizeof(read_msg));  // Read message from pipe
        printf("Child: Received message from parent: %s\n", read_msg);
        close(pipefds[0]);  // Close the read end after reading
    } else {
        // Parent process
        close(pipefds[0]);  // Close the read end of the pipe, parent will only write
        write(pipefds[1], write_msg, strlen(write_msg) + 1);  // Write message to pipe
        close(pipefds[1]);  // Close the write end after writing
        wait(NULL);  // Wait for child process to finish
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Pipe Creation**: The `pipe()` system call creates two file descriptors, one for reading (`pipefds[0]`) and one for writing (`pipefds[1]`).
   
2. **Forking the Process**: The `fork()` system call creates a child process. After forking, the child and parent processes execute simultaneously.

3. **Parent Process**: 
   - The parent closes the **reading** end of the pipe (it doesn’t need to read).
   - It writes a message to the pipe, which is sent to the child process.

4. **Child Process**: 
   - The child closes the **writing** end of the pipe (it doesn’t need to write).
   - It reads the message from the pipe and prints it.

5. **Communication**: The message sent by the parent is read by the child, demonstrating inter-process communication using a pipe.

### Output

```
Child: Received message from parent: Hello from parent!
```

## Conclusion

Pipes are a simple and efficient way to allow communication between processes. In the example above, a parent process sends a message to a child process using a pipe. Pipes are widely used in operating systems for tasks like redirecting output and handling multiple processes efficiently.

Belady anomaly in page replacement algorithms:

In the Operating System, process data is loaded in fixed-sized chunks and each chunk is referred to as a page. The processor loads these pages in fixed-sized chunks of memory called frames. Typically the size of each page is always equal to the frame size.

A page fault occurs when a page is not found in the memory and needs to be loaded from the disk.

If a page fault occurs and all memory frames have been already allocated, then the replacement of a page in memory is required at the request of a new page. This is referred to as demand-paging.

The choice of which page to replace is specified by page replacement algorithms. The commonly used page replacement algorithms are FIFO, LRU, optimal page replacement algorithms, etc.

What is a Page Fault?

- A page fault is a type of interrupt or exception that occurs in a computer’s operating system when a program attempts to access a page of memory that is not currently loaded into physical RAM (Random Access Memory). Instead, the page is stored on disk in a storage space called the page file or swap space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a Belady’s Anomaly?
- Bélády’s anomaly is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for a given memory access pattern. 

This phenomenon is commonly experienced in the following page replacement algorithms: 
- First in first out (FIFO) 
- Second chance algorithm 
- Random page replacement algorithm

Reason for Belady’s Anomaly

1: The other two commonly used page replacement algorithms are Optimal and LRU, but Belady’s Anomaly can never occur in these algorithms for any reference string as they belong to a class of stack-based page replacement algorithms. 

2: A stack-based algorithm is one for which it can be shown that the set of pages in memory for N frames is always a subset of the set of pages that would be in memory with N + 1 frames.

3: For LRU replacement, the set of pages in memory would be the n most recently referenced pages. If the number of frames increases then these n pages will still be the most recently referenced and so, will still be in the memory. 

4: While in FIFO, if a page named b came into physical memory before a page – a then priority of replacement of b is greater than that of a, but this is not independent of the number of page frames and hence, FIFO does not follow a stack page replacement policy and therefore suffers Belady’s Anomaly.

# Structure of the Process Control Block (PCB)

The **Process Control Block (PCB)** is a critical data structure in an operating system. It holds essential information about a specific process and plays a key role in process management and context switching.

## Fields of the Process Control Block:

- **Pointer:** A stack pointer that saves the current position of the process when it is switched from one state to another. This ensures the process can resume from the same point when it is reloaded.
  
- **Process State:** Stores the current state of the process, such as running, ready, blocked, etc.
  
- **Process Number (PID):** A unique identifier (Process ID or PID) assigned to each process.
  
- **Program Counter:** Holds the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.
  
- **Registers:** When a process is scheduled to run, the register values are read from the PCB and loaded into the CPU registers. This field stores the values of CPU registers during process execution.

- **Memory Limits:** Contains information about the memory management system used by the operating system. This may include page tables, segment tables, or other memory management data structures.

- **List of Open Files:** Keeps track of files that are open for the process, allowing the system to manage file access for the process.

## Additional Information in PCB:

- The PCB may also include details about **interrupts** generated by the process and how they were handled by the operating system.
  
- **Context Switching:** The PCB plays a vital role during context switching by saving the state of the current process and restoring the state of the next process.

- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** In real-time operating systems, additional information such as **deadlines** and **priorities** might be required in the PCB.

## Location of the Process Control Block:

The **Process Control Block (PCB)** is stored in a special part of memory that is not accessible to normal users. This is to protect the integrity of the process information. Some operating systems place the PCB at the start of the **kernel stack** for the process, which provides a secure location.

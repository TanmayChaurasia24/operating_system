Structure of the Process Control Block: 

Pointer: It is a stack pointer that is required to be saved when the process is switched from one state to another to retain the current position of the process.

Process state: It stores the respective state of the process.

Process number: Every process is assigned a unique id known as process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.

Program counter: Program Counter stores the counter, which contains the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.

Registers: When the process is scheduled to be run, the register values is read from the PCB and written to the CPU registers. This is the main purpose of the registers in the PCB.

Memory limits: This field contains the information about memory management system used by the operating system. This may include page tables, segment tables, etc.

List of Open files: This information includes the list of files opened for a process.

The PCB also contains information about the interrupts that a process may have generated and how they were handled by the operating system.

The process of switching from one process to another is called context switching. The PCB plays a crucial role in context switching by saving the state of the current process and restoring the state of the next process.

Real-time operating systems may require additional information in the PCB, such as deadlines and priorities

Location of The Process Control Block:

The Process Control Block (PCB) is stored in a special part of memory that normal users canâ€™t access. This is because it holds important information about the process. Some operating systems place the PCB at the start of the kernel stack for the process, as this is a safe and secure spot.
